# Activity 2 Chess
Contains a console app and a windows forms GUI app that both use the same library of classes that define the board and cells.  
Both allow a user to select different kinds of chess pieces and then place them on the board.  The output is the legal moves that the piece can make.
It was good practice to catch all IndexOutOfRangeExceptions when a piece was near the boundaries of the board.
